**FSL-Mate** is a collection of resources for few-shot learning (FSL).  

In particular, FSL-Mate currently contains

- [**FewShot Papers**](./papers.md): a paper list which tracks the research advances on FSL
- [**Paddle FSL**](./paddlefsl/): a PaddlePaddle-based python library for FSL 

We are endeavored to constantly update FSL-Mate. Hopefully, it can make FSL easier. 

## NewsðŸ”¥ 

- [2022-05-10] Add FSL papers published in TheWebConf (previously known as WWW) 2022.

- [2022-04-02] PaddleFSL v1.0.1 is officially released! It now supports bioinformatics applications and diverse few-shot natural language understanding (FewNLU) tasks. Take a look at [here](PaddleFSL/README.md)!

- [2022-03-08] FSL-Mate collaborates with [PaddlePaddle Hackathon](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/PaddlePaddleHackathon-2022-3) and offer three missions to community users: 
[91. Add random search](https://github.com/tata1661/FSL-Mate/issues/19), [92. Add TPE hyperparameter search](https://github.com/tata1661/FSL-Mate/issues/18), and [93. Reorganize MAML and ANIL](https://github.com/tata1661/FSL-Mate/issues/17). Solutions which complete the missions and pass the evaluation will obtain case prizes: 1000 yuan for mission 91, 5000 yuan for mission 92, and 10000 yuan for mission 93. Come and join the Hackathon [here](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/issues/40234)!
